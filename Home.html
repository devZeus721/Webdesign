   <p><b><h1>Definition and Etymology</h1></b></p>

    <p><b>There are several definitions of what constitutes a landscape, depending on context.[2] In common usage however, a landscape refers either to all the visible features of an area of land (usually rural), often considered in terms of aesthetic appeal, or to a pictorial representation of an area of countryside, specifically within the genre of landscape painting. When people deliberately improve the aesthetic appearance of a piece of land—by changing contours and vegetation, etc.—it is said to have been landscaped,[1] though the result may not constitute a landscape according to some definitions.
        <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The word landscape (landscipe or landscaef) arrived in England—and therefore into the English language—after the fifth century, following the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons; these terms referred to a system of human-made spaces on the land. The term landscape emerged around the turn of the sixteenth century to denote a painting whose primary subject matter was natural scenery.[3] Land (a word from Germanic origin) may be taken in its sense of something to which people belong (as in England being the land of the English).[4] The suffix -scape is equivalent to the more common English suffix -ship.

There are several words that are frequently associated with the word landscape:

    Scenery: The natural features of a landscape considered in terms of their appearance, esp. when picturesque: spectacular views of mountain scenery.[1]
    Setting: In works of narrative (especially fictional), it includes the historical moment in time and geographic location in which a story takes place, and helps initiate the main backdrop and mood for a story.[7]
    Picturesque: The word literally means "in the manner of a picture; fit to be made into a picture", and used as early as 1703 (Oxford English Dictionary), and derived from an Italian term pittoresco, "in the manner of a painter". Gilpin's Essay on Prints (1768) defined picturesque as "a term expressive of that peculiar kind of beauty, which is agreeable in a picture" (p. xii).
    A view: "A sight or prospect of some landscape or extended scene; an extent or area covered by the eye from one point" (OED).
    Wilderness: An uncultivated, uninhabited, and inhospitable region.[1] See also Natural landscape.
    Cityscape (also townscape): The urban equivalent of a landscape. In the visual arts a cityscape (urban landscape) is an artistic representation, such as a painting, drawing, print or photograph, of the physical aspects of a city or urban area.
    Seascape: A photograph, painting, or other work of art which depicts the sea, in other words an example of marine art.
